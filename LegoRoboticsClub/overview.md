# LEGO Robotics Club

The LEGO Robotics Club at Robot Garden is for anybody old enough to read.  Fun
for both kids and parents, we will meet regularly to work on projects and
activities to learn robotics concepts and skills built on top of the LEGO
Mindstorms platforms.

Based on member interest we will prepare for club challenges as well as form
teams for competitions such as Jr. FLL, FLL, and RoboGames.  Think Lego Soccer,
TubePush, Bowling, Linefollow, and battles.

There is no charge and you don't need to be a Robot Garden member to
participate, but we will ask for donations to fund club LEGO purchases.

*Parents are required to be present for any minors, lawyer's rule.*
