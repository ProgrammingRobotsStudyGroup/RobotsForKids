# Low-Cost Commercial Robots and Kits
There are many commercial robots that are relatively low cost, oriented around first-time hobbyists. A selected list:
* DFRobot MiniQ v2 ($79, assembled, includes line following, IR proximity detection, IR remote, light sensing, compass)
* MakerBlock mBot ($75, kit, includes line following, ultrasonic distance sensor, light sensor, Bluetooth, IR remote)
* Pololu Zumo ($150, assembled, includes 9DF MMU, encoders, IR proximity sensors, LCD)
* Pololu 3pi ($112, assembled, includes line following, buzzer, pushbuttons, LCD)
* Sparkfun Redbot ($85, kit, includes line following, accelerometer)
* Parallax Boebot for Arduino ($150, kit, includes IR proximity sensors, light sensors, bumpers, curriculum from New Jersey BOE)
* GoPiGo kit for RPi ($90 + RPi, kit)
* Finch ($100?, assembled)
* Arcbotics Sparki ($150, assembled)
* Parallax Scribbler ($130, assembled, includes line following, light sensing)

And many more, of course.
