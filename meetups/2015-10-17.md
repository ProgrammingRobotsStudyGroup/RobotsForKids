## Notes

@javatechs, @j12y, @merose, @lloydrd, Melanie Y

**Goals**

- more members for RG growth
- things for kids to do at RG
- need for more robotics / stem programs, lots of demand
- easier to demonstrate robots at RG

**Who is the Group of People?**

RG has no insurance for kids so require parents to be present so kids cannot be
dropped off without supervision; parents must be involved as well not just
onsite
- cub scout kid+parent model
- setting up plan for not being taken over by parent and engaging parent too

Livermore Girl Scouts, have knowledge of Robots who may participate and looking
for volunteer opportunities

**What are We Doing?**

Example project using Arduino with sample program and instructions to modify it (for 6-8th graders)

Time constraints; projects that can be completed in a short amount of time with
a payoff to be engaged.

Possibilities for chunking so that it is not a marathon project:
- small chunks
- building their own things / designs rather than something pre-designed

TinyTechs locally may be worth checking out because of lack of curriculum;
designed to use LEGO to teach basic machines

5 kits for mindstorms available with Girl Scouts Cabin from original LLNL grant;

Curiosity Hacked, works in several phases so that those who miss can still
catchup

Science Odyssey, etc. there is a large pent up demand for kids getting involved
with robotics, etc.

Open Badges using API may also be organizational function to use model of
Curiosity Hacked, DIY.org, Scouts

LEGO may be a good place to start with young kids.
